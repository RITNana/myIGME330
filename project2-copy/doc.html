    <p>I knew that it would take me a while to figure out how to use the API in order for me to code and display, <br>
        so I focused more on the HTML and JS for this project first, andd delt with the CSS last.
        <br>
        Originally, I had to update the API URL that was used for the Jikan UnOfficial MyAnimeList because it was
        outdated. <br>
        It actually took longer than expected to find the API URL for this API, until I realized there were multiple
        ones to choose from, <br> by the documentation. I decided to use two API URLs in my project because the
        getAnimeSearch and getSchedules
        both had similar, <br>
        yet different parameters that I needed for both in order for my website to work.
    </p>

    <p>One of the challenges I faced was getting my API for the genres, although there was an actual genre API,
        <br>
        it didn't allow me to see the specific animes associated with that genre, nor was I able to set any query
        parameters. <br>
        I decided to use the first API for the anime search and used the 'genres' query parameter to filter out the
        animes
        by genre. <br>
        I moved on to the CSS, where the hard part was figuring out how to display the information. I had gotten an
        idea from one of <br>
        my classmates' example where they put the information of each anime into its own box that would dropdown with
        click,<br>
        so I decided to create a div in my string templating and added the :hover pseudo class, <br>
        which lowered the opacity of the image and displayed the information when you hover over each anime result. <br>
        The CSS, the GIFs, and the custom cursor all came after, which took some Youtube tutorials and attempts to
        accomplish.
    </p>

    <p>I meet the requirements by saving a search term to the localStroage of my website, adding an additional DOM
        element <br>
        feature that allows the user to search for animes by Genre by a select pulldown, and had the correct coding
        conventiosn for my JS, <br>
        valid HTML, and valid CSS. I believe I do deserve an "A" because this project I actually had time to add
        additional features such as <br>
        the custom cursor and a favicon for my Anime Finder Website. I can understand how I may get a "B" because the
        layout of my site is very <br>
        similar to the GIF Finder, but I did incorporate my own styling and additional features pertained to this
        specific API. </p>
