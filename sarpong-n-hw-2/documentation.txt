II. Tell us about the 2 Audio Effect nodes you added to the audio routing graph.

    The two audio effect nodes I added to tjhe audio routing graph were the "Bass" and Treble "Node"
    I decided that returning a different pitch for the audio visualizer would be convenient 

III. Tell us your Sprite's class name, what it looks like/what it does in the visualization

I was not able to finish this part, but the plan was to attempt to draw multiple squares that would populate around
the audio visualizer as the different sounds played. These would have their colors changed randomly, and would scale 
periodically as the visualizer plays.

IV. Tell us what app data you put in your av-data.json file

The app data I put in my av-data.json file was the name of my songs 
and "what-if" information on how my sprites were meant to work

V. Tell us how you improved the aesthetics of the app over the AV HW:
be sure to give yourself a grade for this section, between 0% and 15%
0% would be if there was not a meaningful improvement over the AV HW
15% would be substantial improvement over the AV HW - a "wow" (portfolio-worthy) experience
and everything in between
