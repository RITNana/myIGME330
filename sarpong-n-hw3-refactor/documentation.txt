II. Tell us about the 2 Audio Effect nodes you added to the audio routing graph.
 The two audio effects I added were the treble and bass nodes for obtaining different pitches for the audios

III. Tell us your Sprite's class name, what it looks like/what it does in the visualization
My Sprite class name is called Sprite, but what it does is peridoically animate and scale multiuple rectangles
based on the audio data. 

IV. Tell us what app data you put in your av-data.json file
The app data I put in my JSON file was the title and the filenames of the songs. I also added app instructions

V. Tell us how you improved the aesthetics of the app over the AV HW:
be sure to give yourself a grade for this section, between 0% and 15%

5%, The only main differences I did was take out the gradient and made all the checkboxes for the effects become sliders. 
Although this allows the control to better for the user, there is not much after that. The animation of the rectangles are creative
and intriguing, so I would say that is where i was able to contribute some aesthetic to this visualizer. 

HW-3-Refactor Documentation
The language I coded in was TypeScript. I implictly and explicity typed my paramters and necessary functions in order for the program
to understadn theb intention I had. I also created interfaces for DrawParams and DEFAULTS. Personally, I made sure to have key:value pairs
defined for my Sprite.js class and exported it for visualizer.ts to still function
